== DESCRIPTION:

Super-quick image resizing using the ImageMagick command line tools

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

- Simple API
- 0% Overhead
- Uses the ImageMagick command line tools (convert, identify)

NOTE:
The API is going to be changing a lot as I try to lock down something really useful. As a quick git-er-done type doodad
it works really well, and I'm already using it on some very high volume production sites.

== SYNOPSIS:


First things, first, Tell me where you keep them:


  # Rails: production|development|etc.rb
  # or somewhere that gets loaded before you initialize

  Imanip::Interface::Magick.execute_path = '/path/to/your/bins/' # eg /usr/local/bin/


With an image file at /dir/image.jpg

  image = Imanip::Image.new('/dir/image.jpg')

This will run identify on the image and make sure its convert-able. If it cant read or interpret it it will raise an Imanip::NotAnImageError.

Once you have the image you can check some properties/attributes

  image.width #=> 410 (Fixnum)
  image.height #=> 100 (Fixnum)
  image.format #=> JPEG (String)

There are also some helpers to do some rule based cropping.

  image.portrait? #=> false
  image.landscape? #=> true
  image.orientation #=> :landscape

After that you can resize and whatever

  image.resize('outputfile.jpg', :dimensions => [200,100])

I like crop_resize better. It crops AND resizes so you get an image of the exact pixel dimensions you desire.

  image.crop_resize('/file/to/output.jpg', :width => 50, :height => 50) #=> output file is an exact 50x50 image

You might also want to catch errors, because they will inevitably happen. Possible Errors

  Imanip::Error # the root, the root, the root is on fire
  Imanip::NotAnImageError # Descends from above, thrown during Imanip#Image.new
  Imanip::CouldNotConvertError # Also from above, thrown if theres an issue with #resize or #crop_resize (options, etc.)

More examples coming soon.

== REQUIREMENTS:

You need ImageMagick. Really any version will do, but I am developing with ImageMagick 6.3.3.

[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php]


== INSTALL:

First, install ImageMagick:

[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php]

Make sure you get the command line tools:

  $ which 'convert'

Imanip works as a gem or a plugin for Rails.

As a gem:

  $ sudo gem install imanip

In Rails/environment.rb
  config.gem 'imanip'

Or you can get the ABSOLUTE latest from github:

  $ sudo gem install quirkey-imanip -s http://gems.github.com

To install as a plugin (you need git):

  $ git clone git://github.com/quirkey/imanip.git vendor/plugins/imanip
